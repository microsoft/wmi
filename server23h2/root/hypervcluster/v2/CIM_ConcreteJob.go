	// JobState is an integer enumeration that indicates the operational state of a Job. It can also indicate transitions between these states, for example, 'Shutting Down' and 'Starting'. Following is a brief description of the states:
	///New (2) indicates that the job has never been started.
	///Starting (3) indicates that the job is moving from the 'New', 'Suspended', or 'Service' states into the 'Running' state.
	///Running (4) indicates that the Job is running.
	///Suspended (5) indicates that the Job is stopped, but can be restarted in a seamless manner.
	///Shutting Down (6) indicates that the job is moving to a 'Completed', 'Terminated', or 'Killed' state.
	///Completed (7) indicates that the job has completed normally.
	///Terminated (8) indicates that the job has been stopped by a 'Terminate' state change request. The job and all its underlying processes are ended and can be restarted (this is job-specific) only as a new job.
	///Killed (9) indicates that the job has been stopped by a 'Kill' state change request. Underlying processes might have been left running, and cleanup might be required to free up resources.
	///Exception (10) indicates that the Job is in an abnormal state that might be indicative of an error condition. Actual status might be displayed though job-specific objects.
	///Service (11) indicates that the Job is in a vendor-specific state that supports problem discovery, or resolution, or both.
	///Query pending (12) waiting for a client to resolve a query
	JobState ConcreteJob_JobState

	// The amount of time that the Job is retained after it has finished executing, either succeeding or failing in that execution. The job must remain in existence for some period of time regardless of the value of the DeleteOnCompletion property.
	///The default is five minutes.
	TimeBeforeRemoval string

	// The date or time when the state of the Job last changed. If the state of the Job has not changed and this property is populated, then it must be set to a 0 interval value. If a state change was requested, but rejected or not yet processed, the property must not be updated.
